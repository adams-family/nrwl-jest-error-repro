# TestErrors

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the following error on `ng serve` in case of a `@nrwl/express` app:

```
TS2593: Cannot find name 'describe'. Do you need to install type definitions for a test runner? 
Try `npm i @types/jest` or `npm i @types/mocha` and then add `jest` or `mocha` to the types
field in your tsconfig.
```
